### Things to look into next:
* pipenv vs Poetry vs Conda

pipenv
> pipenv is a wrapper around pip that also creates and manages your virtual environments. It has similarities to conda.

conda
> if youâ€™re using python for data science and all the things you plan on installing are in conda its pretty good, particularly for installing really complicated dependencies with lots of random binaries

### Tools

* Bootstrap with crispy-forms (to generate Bootstrap forms)
* Pillow for images
